        <p class="p2">The Sun is the center of our solar system and all the planets orbit it. It is 5778 kelvin hot
            making it the hottest thing in our solar system. NASA has calculated when our sun turns into a white dwarf, they said
            <q>The Sun is a little less than halfway through its life time and will last another 5 billion years or so
                before it becomes a white dwarf.</q> To learn more details about the sun use the link below.

            brightest object in our night sky apart from the moon and can be seen by the naked eye. 
            Although Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus is actually hotter due to its thick atmosphere full of greenhouse gas 
            carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid. Check out this link for more info on

            Billion humans live on it and over 2-million species of animals on Earth. The Earth is made up of 5 layers, the crust which is the thinnest layer and the one we stand on, the upper mantle, the mantle, the outer core and the inner core. 
            We have explored the surface of the moon and mars more than our own ocean floor. Click the link for more information on our home planet.</p>
